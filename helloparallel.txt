Communication limited the maximum speedup achieved
- In the demo, the communication was telling each other the partial sums
▪ Minimizing the cost of communication improved speedup
- Moved students (“processors”) closer together (or let them shout



Parallel thinking
1. Decomposing work into pieces that can safely be performed in parallel
2. Assigning work to processors
3. Managing communication/synchronization between the processors so that it does not limit speedup


Thinking about e!ciency
▪ FAST != EFFICIENT
Just because your program runs faster on a parallel computer, it does not mean it is using the 
hardware e!ciently
- Is 2x speedup on computer with 10 processors a good result
